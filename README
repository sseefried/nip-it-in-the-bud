Ideas to improve the game:

* Show how many more germs need to be killed to get the next antibiotic.
* Have a charge bar for the antibiotics. You can't use it until you get a certain number of
  germs.
* Drag the antibiotics down to the jar and have it work only on an area.
* Show antibiotic resistance visually.
  - each antibiotic could be a colour and a germ could get "splashed" with a
    colour when it becomes immune. Question: what about progeny?

* Change the spaw points not to be a line.
* Perhaps you don't have to kill all of them.
* More than one click to kill some germs.
* Have a nice effect for the antibiotics.
* Perhaps they don't have to be germs.
* Insects and crops?
* Different properties for the germs.
* If they were insects you could use flocking behaviours.
* To enhance futility add permanence between levels. e.g. parts become infected and
  stay that way.
* Swipe action for penicillin.
* Put a cool down on the touching, but be careful. It could be very annoying.
* Gravity not necessarily needed. Have them flock in patterns.
* pinch gestures to kill.
* Petrie dish instead of a beaker.
* Ideas for how you know whether you're going to die or not:
    - Heart monitor

* What if they could escape.

* Greater game where you stop infection in entire hospital
* Zoom in/zoom out.

* Might not be able to see the whole object at once. Make it 3D and have to rotate it.
