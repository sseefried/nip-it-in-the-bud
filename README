Ideas to improve the game:

* Show how many more germs need to be killed to get the next antibiotic.
* Have a charge bar for the antibiotics. You can't use it until you get a certain number of
  germs.
* Drag the antibiotics down to the jar and have it work only on an area.
* Show antibiotic resistance visually.
  - each antibiotic could be a colour and a germ could get "splashed" with a
    colour when it becomes immune. Question: what about progeny?
